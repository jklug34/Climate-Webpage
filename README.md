# Climate Webpage
Website displaying the result of climate versus latitude analysis of 500+ cities randomly selected around the world.

The purpose of this project was to analyze the relationship between weather and latitude. To explore this relationship in an unbiased manner, an automated script that randomly selects 500+ cities around the world and pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API was created.

After assembling the dataset, various aspects of the weather vs. latitude were plotted in Matplotlib. Factors analyzed included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
